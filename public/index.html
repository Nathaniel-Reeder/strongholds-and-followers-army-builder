        <h2>About This Site</h2>
        <p>
            This website was created with the purpose of making it easy to create and view armies using the Strongholds and Followers 3rd party supplement (by MCDM) for the 5th edition of Dungeons and Dragons.  You can build an army, save it, and recall it for viewing later.  Additionally, you can delete armies or edit their stats.
